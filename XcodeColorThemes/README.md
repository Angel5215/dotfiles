# Xcode Color themes

This folder contains a custom set of colors that I use when working with Xcode. 

## Add it to Xcode

To add these color themes to Xcode just open a Terminal and run the following command to open the folder where Xcode stores its color themes.

```bash
open ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
```

Then just copy the files inside this folder.
