# dotfiles

This repository contains some configuration files I normally use for daily work.

It contains:

* `.zshrc` for any operating system.
* `settings.json` for Visual Studio Code
* `kitty.conf` for Kitty terminal

## Xcode theme

This repository used to host my personal Xcode color theme. It now has its own dedicated repository and it finally has a name of its own: [*Neon Glow*](https://github.com/Angel5215/NeonGlow).

## Tutorials

It also has one tutorial on how to customize your terminal to have images, icons and a colorful prompt. It is currently updated to work for macOS Big Sur. If you notice it is outdated, feel free to raise an issue and I'll update it as soon as possible.

I will also include a tutorial for it in spanish as it was originally written.
